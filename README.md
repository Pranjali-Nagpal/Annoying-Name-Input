## The Annoying Name Input 🎰
Warning: This project is designed to be frustrating. Do not use this in production unless you want to lose all your users. 
## About The Project 
This is a concept for a "Bad User Interface" (Bad UI). Instead of simply letting users type their name, this interface forces them to construct it letter-by-letter using a high-speed slot machine mechanism. 
It turns the simple administrative task of entering a name into a high-stakes game of reflexes, patience, and inevitable typos.
